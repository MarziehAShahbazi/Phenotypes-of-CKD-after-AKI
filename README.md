# Phenotypes-of-CKD-after-AKI
This repository contains data on identifying CKD patients following an AKI diagnosis. Various cohorts of CKD patients are created to understand the role of AKI and previous hospitalization in the progression of CKD. i) AKI after hospitalization before CKD ii) random AKI before CKD; and iii) no AKI before CKD. Prior comorbidities, medications, lab results, and pertinent procedures are considered, and for each cohort of patients, the most prevalent phenotypes are identified.
