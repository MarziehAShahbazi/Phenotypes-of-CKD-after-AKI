# Phenotypes-of-CKD-after-AKI
This repository contains data on identifying various cohorts of CKD patients to understand the role of AKI and previous hospitalization in the progression of CKD. The following patient study cohorts are included: (i) AKI after hospitalization prior to CKD ii) random AKI before CKD; and iii) no AKI before CKD. Prior comorbidities, medications, lab results, and pertinent procedures are considered, and for each cohort of patients, the most prevalent phenotypes are identified. Clustering is used to identify and group the phenotypes of CKD for each cohort.
